# ecommerce-playground-selenium

ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

# Project description
This is a simple personal project used to demonstrate the author's skills in Seelenium + JavaScript testing automation.

Here we will apply the concepts of black box testing, where we will test the page https://ecommerce-playground.lambdatest.io/index.php?route=common/home. 

This project will cover the following aspects of the website:
- Search for a valid term in the top menu and check whether the results page loaded correctly;
- Add a product to the cart;
- Create user;
- Verify user is not able to login with invalid credentials.

# Language, framework and technologies used
Selenium framework was used in this project, and the test cases were created using the JavaScript language, in conjunction with the Page Objects project pattern. To better organize the test cases, it was used the mocha-selenium library. 

To make assertions, it was used the Chai assertion library. 

To generates the report, it was used the mochawesome reporting frameworking.

To generate user data, we used the API obtained from https://randomuser.me/, using the node-fetch library.
